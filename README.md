Ping Pong: 
The application was created on,13th July 2018
## Description
Ping Pong was created to count down numbers from 1 with the following characteristics:
-Numbers divisible by 3 become 'ping'
-Numbers divisible by 5 become 'pong'
-Numbers divisible by 3 and 5 become 'pingpong'

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Start by running a test to ensure your code is correct (I used the console and CodePen was an addition)
* Create the respective HTML,CSS and JS folders.
* Research on the code for PingPong and the BDD parameters required and how to input them.
* Add styling to your web-page.
* Happy-pinpong-ing!

## Known Bugs
Ensure your id's on your HTML are similar to your CSS ids. 
## Technologies Used
 I used HTML for the front-end web-page and Java Script for the back-end part of the web-page.
## Support and contact details
You could slack me at -Louisa Konchellah- if any issue occurs and you need assistance.
